# Data Analysis
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚öæ [Pitch Prediction Model](https://github.com/ZoeHanson/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Pitch-Predicting) | Feb 2025 | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Joblib | Developed a machine learning model to classify pitch types thrown using Statcast data. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning for k-NN, and model evaluation to achieve high accuracy. The final model was serialized using Joblib for deployment and reproducibility.|
| üå° [Urbana Temperature Prediction](https://github.com/ZoeHanson/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Temperature-Predictions) | Jan 2025 | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Joblib | Developed a predictive model to estimate minimum daily temperatures in Urbana, IL, for aiding decisions on transitioning the Market at the Square indoors. Utilized historical weather data, implemented feature engineering, trained a K-Nearest Neighbors regression model, and optimized performance using RMSE. The final model was serialized with Joblib for deployment and reproducibility. |
| üí∞ [Billionaire Predictions](https://github.com/ZoeHanson/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Billionaire-Predictions) | Sep 2024 | Python, Scikit-Learn, StatsModels, Pandas, Matplotlib | Developed a predictive model to classify billionaires as self-made or inheritors using logistic regression. Conducted extensive data cleaning, feature selection, and k-fold cross-validation to optimize performance. Achieved an AUC of 0.86 but identified limitations in model interpretability and reliability due to low log-likelihood scores. Explored interaction terms and suggested future improvements, such as Elastic Net regularization, for enhanced feature selection and model stability. |

# C++
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üó£Ô∏è [Hawaiian Words](https://github.com/ZoeHanson/Cpp/tree/main/Hawaiian-Words) | Sep 2024 | C++, String Manipulation, CLI, Character Processing | Built a tool to validate and phonetically transcribe Hawaiian words based on linguistic rules using C++. Implemented functions to identify valid characters, recognize vowel groupings, and generate accurate pronunciations. Designed a command-line interface for real-time word conversion, integrating robust error handling for invalid inputs. Explored optimization techniques for string processing and pronunciation accuracy, with potential improvements including dictionary-based verification and extended support for Hawaiian place names. |
