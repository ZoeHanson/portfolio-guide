# Data Analysis
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| âš¾ [Pitch Prediction Model](https://github.com/ZoeHanson/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Pitch-Predicting) | Feb 2025 | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Joblib | Developed a machine learning model to classify pitch types thrown using Statcast data. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning for k-NN, and model evaluation to achieve high accuracy. The final model was serialized using Joblib for deployment and reproducibility.|
| ðŸŒ¡ [Urbana Temperature Prediction](https://github.com/ZoeHanson/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Temperature-Predictions) | Jan 2025 | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Joblib | Developed a predictive model to estimate minimum daily temperatures in Urbana, IL, for aiding decisions on transitioning the Market at the Square indoors. Utilized historical weather data, implemented feature engineering, trained a K-Nearest Neighbors regression model, and optimized performance using RMSE. The final model was serialized with Joblib for deployment and reproducibility. |
